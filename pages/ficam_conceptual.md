The Conceptual Diagram is a graphical depiction of the three main components of ICAM:  

* [**Identity Management**]({{site.baseurl}}/services/identity) allows an organization to construct a trusted digital identity based on an individual's defining attributes, such as the individual's birth date and fingerprints. Identity management includes the following ICAM services:
    * Identity Proofing
    * Creation
    * Maintenance
    * Identity Resolution
    * Deactivation
* [**Credential Management**]({{site.baseurl}}/services/credentials) allows an organization to associated a digital identity with a credential, which is authoritative proof of that claimed identity. Credential management includes the following ICAM services:
    * Sponsorship
    * Registration
    * Issuance
    * Maintenance
    * Revocation
* [**Access Management**]({{site.baseurl}}/services/access) allows an organization to leverage trusted identities and authoritative credentials to ensure only permitted individuals are granted access to protected resources, such as doors or computers. Access Management includes the following ICAM services:
    * Policy Administration
    * Entitlement Management
    * Provisioning
    * Authentication
    * Authorization

For more information about ICAM services, see [Services Framework]({{site.baseurl}}/services/).

Throughout the FICAM Architecture, the colors and symbols you see here are used to map new concepts back to these core areas. For example, whenever you see purple and the person icon, that concept relates to Identity Management. Green and the document icon relate to Credential Management. Blue and the lock icon relate to Access Management.  Any element that shows all three colors relates to ICAM as a whole.

At the bottom of the diagram, there are boxes for two overarching concepts: Governance and Federation. Governance is the process of managing and overseeing an ICAM program. Federation describes an environment where organizations exchange and accept each other’s ICAM information.  

For more, see [Governance]({{site.baseurl}}/services/governance) and [Federation]({{site.baseurl}}/services/federation).

### Background & Key Revisions

The previous conceptual diagram showed many elements of ICAM all at once. This diagram is centered on the three core areas of ICAM and is meant to build foundational ICAM knowledge. The more complex business processes that the previous diagram depicted can now be found in the [Use Cases]({{site.baseurl}}/usecases/).

This diagram also describes Governance and Federation, which the previous version did not include.

Lastly, this diagram establishes the visual style and symbols that are now used throughout the FICAM Architecture.
