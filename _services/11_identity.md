Identity Management is the set of practices that allow an
organization to establish, maintain, and terminate identities.

An **IDENTITY** is the set of characteristics (also called
*attributes*) that describe an individual. Individuals have unique identities, or personas, depending on the context:

* Your identity at the Department of
Motor Vehicles (DMV) is different from your identity
at your bank.
* A person who is both a government
contractor and an Army Reservist has two
identities, one in each context.

Identities change and evolve (you may get a
promotion, change your hair color, or receive additional
training) and can be terminated (you may turn in your
driver’s license when you move to another state), but
identities do not expire.

**IDENTITY PROOFING** is the process by which an organization initially establishes an identity. This process can be simple or complex,
depending on the Level of Assurance, or strength, that the organization requires:

* The process for a frequent shopper program at the
local grocery store is weak.

* The process required by the DMV is stronger,
typically requiring multiple forms of evidence, such as
leases, mortgages, and utility bills.

* The process required by the Federal Government is
stronger still.

An **IDENTIFIER** is a unique attribute that can be used to
locate a specific identity within its context:

* While the DMV issues multiple driver’s licenses bearing
the same name (there is more than one John Smith in
the state), each will have a different driver’s license
number.
