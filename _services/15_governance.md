Governance is the set of practices that allow organizations to successfully administer, execute, and support the core ICAM services and functions. Governance, for the purpose of this services framework, refers to the capabilities necessary to ensure successful ICAM operations, rather than the management of an entire enterprise. Governance functions enable organizations to make programmatic decisions, manage enterprise policies, and promote the efficiency of their ICAM program. 

An organization can use enterprise governance to develop and implement policies, rules, and procedures to operate an ICAM program as smoothly as possible. As part of governance, an organization also collects data to monitor, analyze, and report on how well an ICAM program conforms with established rules and policies.

You must remediate any problems or vulnerabilities in the program discovered through monitoring. These vulnerabilities can lead to a security or privacy breach. To ensure continuity of service, you must be prepared to execute an established recovery plan.
