The Services Framework identifies the services that provide functionality within the scope of ICAM. You can use the Services Framework to translate between business requirements and technical solutions.  

The ICAM Services are defined for the five conceptual practice areas, with descriptions and simple diagrams for you to use:

* [Identity Management]({{site.baseurl}}{{page.url}}identity)

* [Access Management]({{site.baseurl}}{{page.url}}access)
* [Federation]({{site.baseurl}}{{page.url}}federation)
* [Governance]({{site.baseurl}}{{page.url}}governance)
