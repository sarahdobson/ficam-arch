The Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management (FICAM) goals and objectives identify the aims and outcomes to which all federal agency ICAM programs should contribute.  

The visual includes four goals, each with its own objectives. The goals are broad, aspirational statements, whereas the objectives are the more concrete actions that should be taken to meet those goals.

### Background & Key Revisions

The updated Goals & Objectives convey both general cybersecurity goals and how ICAM contributes to each goal’s success. The new language makes clear that ICAM goals accomplish high level aspirations of the Federal Government, whereas objectives describe actionable ways to achieve those goals. Lastly, the update replaced the compliance-focused goal with descriptions throughout the document about how ICAM inherently contributes to federal compliance.
