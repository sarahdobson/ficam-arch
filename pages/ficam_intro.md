Welcome to the _in-progress_ site for the Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management (FICAM) Enterprise Architecture! This page is your first stop to learn about FICAM, understand the FICAM Enterprise Architecture, and contribute to its development.

#### What is ICAM?

**Identity, Credential, and Access Management** (ICAM) is the set of security disciplines that allows an
organization to:

> **_enable the right individual to access the right resource, at the right time, for the right reason_**

ICAM is the tools, policies, and systems that allow an organization to manage, monitor, and secure access to protected resources.
These resources may be electronic files, computer systems, or physical resources such as server rooms and buildings. The image below depicts a conceptual view of ICAM:

#### What is FICAM?

FICAM is the Federal Government’s implementation of ICAM. FICAM provides a common set of ICAM standards, best practices, and implementation guidance for federal agencies.  

See [Goals & Objectives]({{site.baseurl}}/goals/) for more information about how FICAM supports the Federal Government's security goals.

#### What is the FICAM Architecture?

An enterprise architecture (EA) is a conceptual plan that defines an organization's structure and function, and how that organization designs, plans, and executes its goals.

The FICAM Architecture is the Federal Government’s EA for implementing ICAM. The FICAM Architecture depicts principles and practices in diagrams and stories to define ICAM and the capabilities it provides to an agency. While the FICAM Architecture provides a general, government-wide view of ICAM, the design is flexible to allow agencies to shape the FICAM Architecture to their unique implementation environments.

The FICAM Architecture provides several different views of ICAM:

- Concepts and goals from a high level
- Definition of the business environment, including its services and processes
- Technology that empowers the business

Each element of the FICAM Architecture aligns with one of the six sub-architecture domains described in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/egov_docs/fea_v2.pdf">Common Approach to Federal Enterprise Architecture</a> (FEA):

#### Who is the FICAM Architecture for, and how should Federal agencies use it?

The FICAM Architecture is a robust and scalable framework that is equally useful to both enterprise architects developing an agency’s ICAM program, and to those new to ICAM who are learning its core concepts.

If you are new to ICAM, begin by reviewing the Architecture from top to bottom. The FICAM Architecture functions to help you quickly develop a baseline understanding of what ICAM is and how ICAM impacts your organization.

If you are an enterprise architect seasoned in ICAM, you can begin by comparing your agency’s ICAM program to the principles and elements of the FICAM Architecture. This comparison may help you identify areas where your agency’s ICAM program is underdeveloped, and plan for future expansion and improvement.

In general, federal agencies and departments should use the FICAM Architecture as a guide to establish a baseline understanding of the federal approach to ICAM, and as a tool to help improve ICAM implementations.

#### What is this site, and where do I go from here?

This site has two purposes:

*  To provide an authoritative location where anyone can access the most up-to-date version of the FICAM Architecture, and
*  To serve as a collaborative space where subject matter experts and members of the ICAM community can work to revise and refine the Architecture over time.

If you are new to the FICAM Architecture, in the left navigation bar, begin with the Conceptual Diagram and work downwards through the various elements of the Architecture.

If you want to contribute a new idea or suggest a revision to the existing Architecture documents, in the left navigation bar, click **Contribute** to learn how.
