The Conceptual Diagram is a graphical depiction of the three main components of Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM):  

* [**Identity Management**]({{site.baseurl}}/services/identity) allows an organization to construct a trusted digital identity based on an individual's defining attributes, such as the individual's birth date and fingerprints. Identity management includes the following ICAM services:
    * Identity Proofing
    * Creation
    * Maintenance
    * Identity Resolution
    * Deactivation
* [**Credential Management**]({{site.baseurl}}/services/credentials) allows an organization to associate a digital identity with a credential, which is authoritative proof of that claimed identity. Credential management includes the following ICAM services:
    * Sponsorship
    * Registration
    * Issuance
    * Maintenance
    * Revocation
* [**Access Management**]({{site.baseurl}}/services/access) allows an organization to leverage trusted identities and authoritative credentials to ensure only permitted individuals can access protected resources, such as doors or computers. Access Management includes the following ICAM services:
    * Policy Administration
    * Entitlement Management
    * Provisioning
    * Authentication
    * Authorization
    
The Conceptual Diagram also contains the following overarching concepts:
* [**Governance**]({{site.baseurl}}/services/governance) is the process of managing and overseeing an ICAM program.
* [**Federation**]({{site.baseurl}}/services/federation) is the environment where organizations exchange and accept each other's ICAM information.

For more information about ICAM services, see [Services Framework]({{site.baseurl}}/services/).

Throughout the Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management (FICAM) Architecture, we color-code concepts to match the sections of the Conceptual Diagram. The purple person icon indicates Identity Management concepts, the green document icon indicates Credential Management concepts, and the blue lock icon indicates Access Management concepts. Any element that shows all three colors relates to ICAM as a whole.

#### How should I use this page?
This guide is meant to be a primary reference for core ICAM concepts. Itâ€™s your starting point to understand the next layer of ICAM, the [Services Framework]({{site.baseurl}}/services/), and beyond.

Please feel free to copy the graphics and text from this page to use at your agency to drive ICAM awareness and understanding!

### Background & Key Revisions

The previous conceptual diagram was complex and included many ICAM elements and business processes. The new diagram depicts the three core areas of ICAM and is meant to build foundational ICAM knowledge. This diagram also includes Governance and Federation, which the previous version did not include.

To view the previous diagram, see [Use Cases]({{site.baseurl}}/usecases/).

Lastly, this diagram establishes the visual style and symbols used throughout the FICAM Architecture.
